LESS-game done for course Programiranje 2 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana. Contributors: Vid Križnar and Gal Bumbar.
The game is a digital reconstruction of the physical game named "LESS" and has identical rules. The rules and a short gameplay sample can be found at: http://www.less-game.com.
You can start the game by double-clicking LESS.jar.
Our version has 4 modes: player vs player, player vs computer and computer vs player (and player vs computer for color shift). You can toggle between modes in the tab "Igra" found in the upper left of the window.
There is also an "undo move" option in the "Uredi potezo" tab, also found in the upper left of the window.
When one of the players is the computer, you may set the difficulty level in the tab "Stopnja težavnosti" again, in the upper left of the window.
